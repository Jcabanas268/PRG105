# Printing poem

print("Moon-Catchin' Net\n")

print("I've made me a moon-catchin' net,")
print("And I'm goin' huntin' tonight,")
print("I'll run along swingin' it over my head,")
print("And grab for that big ball of light.\n")

print("So tomorrow just look at the sky,")
print("And if there's no moon you can bet")
print("I've found what I sought and I finally caught")
print("The moon in my moon-catchin' net.\n")

print("But if the moon's still shinin' there,")
print("Look close underneath and you'll get")
print("A clear look at me in the sky swingin' free")
print("With a star in my moon-catchin' net.\n")
